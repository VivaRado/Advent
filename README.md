##  **Introduction**

Advent Pro is a modern display typeface, designed in 2007, this is the new version (4 of 2019-2020) that is delivered as a variable font, along with the classic formats. It supports 14 weights including italics. It is currently maintained and released by VivaRado, by it's original designer Andreas Kalpakidis. What is unique about this version is that thanks to the strict requirements of the Variable Format, all the glyph contours have been reworked, with amazing attention to quality. Then we compressed the kerning to a great degree making the font superbly kerned and compact at the same time.

If you need a font, use #AdventPro, everything else is your mind playing tricks on you.

### **Introduction / Project Overview / Background**

Advent was originally designed during a two year period by Andreas Kalpakidis, in Athens and later in Komotini, Greece during 2006 to 2007. It was an attempt to break some of the Greek script rules and some of the Latin script rules on letterform grouping. All the letters have been in a sense simplified, and Greek Letters where fitted into Latin groups visually. The overall designed was intended to be light, the font is not intended for text but for headlines, logos, and other short message formats as a display font.

---

### **Introduction / Project Overview / Need**

During 2007 there was a common problem of lack of Greek fonts, even though some agencies took this as an opportunity, Advent was released for free. It was a project that never intended to be something other than an expression of a minimal typographic style.

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction**

**Initiation Phase**:

This documentation being part of VivaRado ORGDOC has been implemented over the old advent documentation. Advent itself since 2007 had no real repository or vendor entity other than it was on release by multiple websites for free fonts.

---

**Planning Phase**:

All the information on how Advent was updated, produced and offered.

Identified Solution Options:
	
*  Update the old Advent Font to Variable.
*  Redesign the old Advent Font to Variable and Include Italics.

---

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction / Initiation Phase / Business Case / Strategic case**

During the initiation of the redesign of Advent, VivaRado as the current vendor, had to undergo a tool design process, as there was a clear need for faster integration of the new design, we realised that we needed a tool to somehow control the decentralised, but very helpful UFO format.

---

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction / Initiation Phase / Business Case / Management case**

The management case tests the feasibility of the preferred option, in terms of its deliverability within various tolerances. 


#### Achievability:

By implementing a set of scripts that are now part of VRD TYPL. We could manage a set of UFOs by combining the repeated parts, and keeping them as intact as possible in terms of the UFO format, we introduced internally the EFO as a pseudoformat that allows for implementation of scripts on a whole family of weights. This allowed us to overcome the decentralisation of UFOs and move forward and produce Advent successfully.

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction / Planning Phase / Safe Planning / Project Plan / Design**

Advent originally featured 7 weights of geometric sharp curved high rise forms and modernized Greek Letters. This realease features 14 weights, the original updated and improved forms along with italics.

---

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction / Planning Phase / Safe Planning / Project Plan / Production**

To produce the font, Illustrator and Fontlab was used originally in 2007, updating to Advent  Pro Variable in 2018, a set of scripts for Adobe Illustrator (JSX) and Fontlab (Python) where written, additionally python scripts and bash, for the composition and kerning. Later on VRD Typography Library was introduced allowing for easier modifications to the font by utilizing a new format - a container for UFO, called the EFO. VRD TYPL for kerning - and compression and Googles fontmake to compile the final variable font. 

Work was done on a Linux box with VirtualBox running Windows 8 and Mac OSX Lion.

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction / Planning Phase / Safe Planning / Project Plan / Kerning**

With the help of Typefacet Integrated Autokern, we have obtained the first layer of kerning for the upright bold.
By using VRD TYPL Kerning Adjust, 
we made the corrections, and the rest of the optimisations required per weight.

We have Classified our glyphs in a way where no kerning loss is observed. By dividing by Language Set, without language intrusion between classes.
Small Case and Capitals are also non intruding. This increases size minimally but maintains kerning pair loss at zero.

During the process we attempted to maintain the Italics width according to the contour. This created a larger alteration size and jittering italics transition due to changing width - even if the kerning was precise. We eventually opted for the slant-to-right-side-corner and maintained the regular kerning along to the italics and smoother animation on Italics.

---

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction / Planning Phase / Safe Planning / Project Plan / Kerning / Standard Sets**

All the letter combinations have been kerned but we also perform testing afterwards, for various reasons (Ommited) some kerning pairs are not included. This brings us to testing the kerning on a specific set of letters, the other letters are left to maintain the mechanical, automated kerning.

VivaRado standard kerning sets are defined as follows:

 - Letter Based(LB):

	- Latin Capitals(LBLC):
	  - ```A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z```
	- Latin SmallCase(LBLS):
	  - ```a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y```
	- Greek (GREEK UNICODES)(LBGC):
	  - ```Α Β Γ Δ Ε Ζ Η Θ Ι Κ Λ Μ Ν Ξ Ο Π Ρ Σ Τ Υ Φ Χ Ψ Ω```
	- Greek SmallCase(LBGS):
	  - ```α β γ δ ε ζ η θ ι κ λ μ ν ξ ο π ρ σ ς τ υ φ χ ψ ω```
	- Numbers(LBNU):
	  - ```0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9```

 - Resulting Permutations that have been Adjusted:

	- Letter Based Permutations (LB):

	  - Latin VS Latin Capitals Letter Based Permutation (LBLCLC)
	  - Latin VS Latin SmallCase Letter Based Permutation (LBLSLS)
	  - Latin Capitals VS Latin SmallCase Letter Based Permutation (LBLCLS)

	  - Greek VS Greek Capitals Letter Based Permutation (LBGCGC)
	  - Greek VS Greek SmallCase Letter Based Permutation (LBGSGS)
	  - Greek Capitals VS Greek SmallCase Letter Based Permutation (LBGCGS)

 - Letter to Letter Adjustments:
	- These are small adjustments due to design quirks, and when we decide that a glyph doesn't fit into classes or the class is not satisfying the kerning requirements completely.
 - Ommited:
	- Cross Language System Kerning (grek to latn and latn to grek).
	- Greek "sigma1" on the Left Side for all Greek.


Version >4.000 is pending Cyrillic Kerning.

---

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction / Planning Phase / Safe Planning / Project Plan / Kerning / Results**

The resulting kerning is:

```{'GG': 4458, 'GL': 761, 'LG': 708, 'LL': 166}```

Total Pairs: ```6093```


More information in: [Kerning Pair Details](https://github.com/VivaRado/Advent/blob/master/docs/kerning_adjustments/kerning_pair_details)

**If you notice a possible kerning improvement we would like to hear about it.**

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction / Planning Phase / Safe Planning / Project Plan / Components**

Components are created by first running VRD/TYPL/SIMEX to obtain a component similarity index, then VRD/TYPL/COMPONENTS to Componentize the EFO,
later you can export to Componentized UFOs.

#### Script Expansion

During script expansion (SE), we have a NAM file, with unicode and name information [located here](README/plans/ADV3_SeC_integration). And the appropriate MO PDF files for each weight or MO. The work takes place per MO or weight, per glyph and the appropriate procedues take place. The MG (Generated Masters) don't need new vectors, just adjustments so those masters don't have PDF files with vectors. The task is then to position the vectors in the font. While working with the plans we update them to reflect the given changes. At the same time we repair any notable contour fixes, width fixes and whatever we see that is out of order.

We have divided the vector integration work to given procedures:

*  GP (Glyph Placement)
*  WA (Width Adjustment)
*  GF (Glyph Fix)

---

**Glyph Placement**:

When dealing with a MO (Original Master), we initially position the vectors in the font, without any worry for width. Glyph Placement also deals with assigning components.

**Width Adjustment**:

This deals with the adjustment of the glyph width where we determine if we have similar looking glyphs and transfer the width to the newly added glyph.

**Glyph Fix**:

This is intended for the MG (Generated Masters), like italics or wide version where we keep the original glyphs but adjust them after applying an effect like slant or width.

#### Glyph Distributor

For integrating the glyphs to the EFO we use the Glyph Distributor, it is responsible for taking glif files from provided UFO and placing it to the appropriate EFO directory. Updating the glyphlib and the contents file.


---

From the ADV3_SeC_integration file:

```
1024 0x0400 Ѐ CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER IE WITH GRAVE False
	GP_MG (thn,reg,bld), 
	WA_MO (thn,reg,bld), 
	GF_MG (thn_it,reg_it,bld_it), 
	WA_MG (thn_it,reg_it,bld_it)
```

We can then see that this glyph has been updated with the following procedures:

*  GP_MG (Glyph Placement):
	*  Component from existing glyphs like "E". This glyph has been placed for three Generated Masters (thn,reg,bld)
*  WA_MO (Width Adjustment):
	*  Widths (bearings) have been adjusted. This glyph widths have been adjusted for three Original Masters (thn,reg,bld)
*  GF_MG (Glyph Fix):
	*  This glyph was fixed after application of an effect like slant or width. This glyph has been fixed for three Generated Masters (thn_it,reg_it,bld_it)
*  WA_MG (Width Adjustment):
	*  Widths (bearings) have been adjusted. This glyph widths have been adjusted for three Generated Masters (thn_it,reg_it,bld_it)

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction / Planning Phase / Safe Planning / Project Plan / Delivery**

Advent Pro Variable is delivered in 4 weight, 8 italic and 4 width Masters, variable formats come in flavors with segmented axes and a definitive version which includes all axes (wght,wdth,ital).

The delivered font files are provided in UFO, OTF, EFO and VAR TTF

[All the above files are available here](https://github.com/VivaRado/Advent/blob/master/font_source/UFOs).

To keep things simple for the initial release, we don't generate intermediate instances as standalone OTFs, this brings the total of available weights deriving from only the masters to 16. If any intermediate instances offered are present they may be lagging behind those main 16. The available OTF files are 16 for Standard release and 54 for Extended Release. For all other formats we offer only the standard release.

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction / Planning Phase / Safe Planning / Schedule Planning**

Overview:

**2019-06-12**:

We are preparing our approval documents for our stakeholders to review, for Script Extension to Cyrillic for version 3.

**2019-07-06**:

We have a layout for the plan of Script Extension and Master Extension that will take place between 2019-04-27 until 2019-06-02.

We will initially design and integrate the Cyrillic to Advent∞3, to 3 Original Masters (MO) and 3 Generated Master (MG). The design and integration for Advent∞3 SeC will take approximately 11 days. At this point Advent∞3 will be available with Cyrillic at 7 Instances of Upright and 7 Instances of Italic.

After that we will branch and update the Advent∞3 to Advent∞4: 3 MO and 3 MG with additional Masters 1 MO and 9 MG, Initially we will do a Master Extension for all the new masters. That will cover the Black, Wide axes and Wide Italic and result to Advent∞4. Approximately by the end of July.

The planning is for alphabetic glyphs and does not include any calculation of additional glyphs of any form. We will have to review the progress and update accordingly. After the review of the plan and assignment of additional tasks for fulfilment of additional glyphs, kerning and arbitrary corrections, Advent∞4 will be available with Cyrillic at 18 Instances of Upright and Upright Wide, 18 Instances of Italic and Italic Wide, total of 36 Instances.

**2019-11-23**:

We have just finished the main work on all the wide masters from thin, regular, bold and finally black. This means that it is time for minor adjustments and iterations on these masters, after this we can conclude the work by generating the italics for those masters.
