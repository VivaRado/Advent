##  **Introduction**

Advent Pro is a modern display typeface, designed in 2007, this is the new version (#3.001 of 2019) that is delivered as a variable font, along with the classic formats. It supports 14 weights including italics. It is currently maintained and released by VivaRado, by it's original designer Andreas Kalpakidis. What is unique about this version is that thanks to the strict requirements of the Variable Format, all the glyph contours have been reworked, with amazing attention to quality. Then we compressed the kerning to a great degree making the font superbly kerned and compact at the same time.

*   Project Name: Advent Pro Variable
*   Type family name: Advent Pro Var (Advent Professional Variable)
*   Proposal Date: 22/08/2018

---

### **Introduction / Project Overview / Background**

Advent was originally designed during a two year period by Andreas Kalpakidis, in Athens and later in Komotini, Greece during 2006 to 2007. It was an attempt to break some of the Greek script rules and some of the Latin script rules on letterform grouping. All the letters have been in a sense simplified, and Greek Letters where fitted into Latin groups visually. The overall designed was intended to be light, the font is not intended for text but for headlines, logos, and other short message formats as a display font.

---

### **Introduction / Project Overview / Need**

During 2007 there was a common problem of lack of Greek fonts, even though some agencies took this as an opportunity, Advent was released for free. It was a project that never intended to be something other than an expression of a minimal typographic style.

---

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction**

**Initiation Phase**:

This documentation being part of VivaRado ORGDOC has been implemented over the old advent documentation. Advent itself since 2007 had no real repository or vendor entity other than it was on release by multiple websites for free fonts.

---

**Planning Phase**:

All the information on how Advent was updated, produced and offered.

	1.  **Strategic case**
	1.  **Management case**


---

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction / Initiation Phase / Business Case / Solution Options**

Identified Solution Options:
	
*  Update the old Advent Font to Variable.
*  Redesign the old Advent Font to Variable and Include Italics.

---

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction / Initiation Phase / Business Case / Strategic case**

During the initiation of the redesign of Advent, VivaRado as the current vendor, had to undergo a tool design process, as there was a clear need for faster integration of the new design, we realised that we needed a tool to somehow control the decentralised, but very helpful UFO format.

---

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction / Initiation Phase / Business Case / Management case**

The management case tests the feasibility of the preferred option, in terms of its deliverability within various tolerances. 


#### Achievability:

By implementing a set of scripts that are now part of VRD TYPL. We could manage a set of UFOs by combining the repeated parts, and keeping them as intact as possible in terms of the UFO format, we introduced internally the EFO as a pseudoformat that allows for implementation of scripts on a whole family of weights. This allowed us to overcome the decentralisation of UFOs and move forward and produce Advent successfully.

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction / Planning Phase**

The Planning Phase, is where the project solution is further developed in as much detail as possible and the steps necessary to meet the project’s objectives.

The Planning Phase consists of:

1.  **Safe Planning**
1.  **Stakeholders**
1.  **Quality Plan (PQP)**


At this point, the project would have been planned in detail and is ready to be executed.

---

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction / Planning Phase / Safe Planning**

The project's **Work Planning / Project Plan** is created outlining the activities, tasks, dependencies, and timeframes.


*  **Safe Planning** Components (Scope Management): 

	*  Projeect Plan:
	*  Work Planning:
		*  Tasks Assignments
		*  Dependencies
	*  Schedule Planning.
		*  Timeline

---

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction / Planning Phase / Safe Planning / Project Plan**

Decide on the encoding sets and supported language scripts. Decide and plan the weights and how you will generate each weight. Understand the procedures and steps. Calculate or keep track of timelines, steps procedures and pitfalls.

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction / Planning Phase / Safe Planning / Project Plan / Design**

Advent originally featured 7 weights of geometric sharp curved high rise forms and modernized Greek Letters. This realease features 14 weights, the original updated and improved forms along with italics.

---

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction / Planning Phase / Safe Planning / Project Plan / Production**

To produce the font, Illustrator and Fontlab was used originally in 2007, updating to Advent  Pro Variable in 2018, a set of scripts for Adobe Illustrator (JSX) and Fontlab (Python) where written, additionally python scripts and bash, for the composition and kerning. Later on VRD Typography Library was introduced allowing for easier modifications to the font by utilizing a new format - a container for UFO, called the EFO. VRD TYPL for kerning - and compression and Googles fontmake to compile the final variable font. 

Work was done on a Linux box with VirtualBox running Windows 8 and Mac OSX Lion.

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction / Planning Phase / Safe Planning / Project Plan / Kerning**

With the help of Typefacet Integrated Autokern, we have obtained the first layer of kerning for the upright bold.
By using VRD TYPL Kerning Adjust, 
we made the corrections, and the rest of the optimisations required per weight.

We have Classified our glyphs in a way where no kerning loss is observed. By dividing by Language Set, without language intrusion between classes.
Small Case and Capitals are also non intruding. This increases size minimally but maintains kerning pair loss at zero.

During the process we attempted to maintain the Italics width according to the contour. This created a larger alteration size and jittering italics transition due to changing width - even if the kerning was precise. We eventually opted for the slant-to-right-side-corner and maintained the regular kerning along to the italics and smoother animation on Italics.

---

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction / Planning Phase / Safe Planning / Project Plan / Kerning / Standard Sets**

All the letter combinations have been kerned but we also perform testing afterwards, for various reasons (Ommited) some kerning pairs are not included. This brings us to testing the kerning on a specific set of letters, the other letters are left to maintain the mechanical, automated kerning.

VivaRado standard kerning sets are defined as follows:

 - Letter Based(LB):

	- Latin Capitals(LBLC):
	  - ```A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z```
	- Latin SmallCase(LBLS):
	  - ```a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y```
	- Greek (GREEK UNICODES)(LBGC):
	  - ```Α Β Γ Δ Ε Ζ Η Θ Ι Κ Λ Μ Ν Ξ Ο Π Ρ Σ Τ Υ Φ Χ Ψ Ω```
	- Greek SmallCase(LBGS):
	  - ```α β γ δ ε ζ η θ ι κ λ μ ν ξ ο π ρ σ ς τ υ φ χ ψ ω```
	- Numbers(LBNU):
	  - ```0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9```

 - Resulting Permutations that have been Adjusted:

	- Letter Based Permutations (LB):

	  - Latin VS Latin Capitals Letter Based Permutation (LBLCLC)
	  - Latin VS Latin SmallCase Letter Based Permutation (LBLSLS)
	  - Latin Capitals VS Latin SmallCase Letter Based Permutation (LBLCLS)

	  - Greek VS Greek Capitals Letter Based Permutation (LBGCGC)
	  - Greek VS Greek SmallCase Letter Based Permutation (LBGSGS)
	  - Greek Capitals VS Greek SmallCase Letter Based Permutation (LBGCGS)

 - Letter to Letter Adjustments:
	- These are small adjustments due to design quirks, and when we decide that a glyph doesn't fit into classes or the class is not satisfying the kerning requirements completely.
 - Ommited:
	- Cross Language System Kerning (grek to latn and latn to grek).
	- Greek "sigma1" on the Left Side for all grek.

---

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction / Planning Phase / Safe Planning / Project Plan / Kerning / Results**

The resulting kerning is:

```{'GG': 4458, 'GL': 761, 'LG': 708, 'LL': 166}```

Total Pairs: ```6093```


More information in: [Kerning Pair Details](https://github.com/VivaRado/Advent/blob/master/docs/kerning_adjustments/kerning_pair_details)

**If you notice a possible kerning improvement we would like to hear about it.**


---

### **Introduction / Phase Introduction / Planning Phase / Safe Planning / Project Plan / Components**

Components are created by first running VRD/TYPL/SIMEX to obtain a component similarity index, then VRD/TYPL/COMPONENTS to Componentize the EFO,
later you can export to Componentized UFOs.
