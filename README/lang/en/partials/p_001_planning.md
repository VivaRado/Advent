**Qazaq.org** serves as a pilot for **VivaRado**. During this project we attempt to integrate all of our procedures for authoring web portals, integrating documentation throughout the project. We have divided the project into the **Main Project** that is the **qazaq.org**, and **Project Modules**. Each of those parts has it's own set of development and design requirements.
