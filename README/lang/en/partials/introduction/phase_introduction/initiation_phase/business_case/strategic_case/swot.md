Strengths describe what an organization excels at and separates it from the competition: a strong brand, loyal customer base, a strong balance sheet, unique technology and so on. For example, a hedge fund may have developed a proprietary trading strategy that returns market-beating results. It must then decide how to use those results to attract new investors.

Weaknesses stop an organization from performing at its optimum level. They are areas where the business needs to improve to remain competitive: higher-than-industry-average turnover, high levels of debt, an inadequate supply chain or lack of capital.

Opportunities refer to favorable external factors that an organization can use to give it a competitive advantage. For example, a car manufacturer can export its cars into a new market, increasing sales and market share, if a country cuts tariffs.

Threats refer to factors that have the potential to harm an organization. For example, a drought is a threat to a wheat-producing company, as it may destroy or reduce the crop yield. Other common threats include things like rising costs for inputs, increasing competition, tight labor supply and so on.
