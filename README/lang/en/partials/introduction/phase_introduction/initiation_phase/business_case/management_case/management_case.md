The management case tests the feasibility of the preferred option, in terms of its deliverability within various tolerances. 


#### Achievability:

By implementing a set of scripts that are now part of VRD TYPL. We could manage a set of UFOs by combining the repeated parts, and keeping them as intact as possible in terms of the UFO format, we introduced internally the EFO as a pseudoformat that allows for implementation of scripts on a whole family of weights. This allowed us to overcome the decentralisation of UFOs and move forward and produce Advent successfully.
