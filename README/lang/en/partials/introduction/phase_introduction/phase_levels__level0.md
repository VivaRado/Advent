#### Level 0:

We initiate a project by providing the Level 0 Documentation. That is creating a **Profile**, making clear about how the **Organisational Documents** work. Present a minimum **Project Overview**, by describing the **Background** and **Need** for solutions. Then we enter the **Initiation Phase** and create a light **Business Case**, with minimum components **Strategic Case** where we generate **Solution Options** that match the requested strategy. Then for each of the **Solution Options**, we can create a Level 0 Strategic Score by **Evaluating** them based on the **Financial Case** and **Management Case**. For each of those **Solution Options** we create a **SWOT**. The selected **Solution Options** and **Evaluation**, then the selected options can be expanded by Level 1 and proceed to the **Planning Phase**. **Risk Planning** and **Quality Plan** is secondary at this stage but they can be in place ready to accomodate. As a project might from the start have **Quality Targets** and identified **RAID** components.
