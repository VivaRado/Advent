Advent was originally designed during a two year period by Andreas Kalpakidis, in Athens and later in Komotini, Greece during 2006 to 2007. It was an attempt to break some of the Greek script rules and some of the Latin script rules on letterform grouping. All the letters have been in a sense simplified, and Greek Letters where fitted into Latin groups visually. The overall designed was intended to be light, the font is not intended for text but for headlines, logos, and other short message formats as a display font.
